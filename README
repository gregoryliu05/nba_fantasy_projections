## Overview 
This project aims to build an NBA player projection model that assesses player performance and predicts potential breakout candidates. By considering factors like player age, injuries, consistency, trade impacts, and development trends, the model will help provide a clearer outlook on whether a player is likely to outperform or regress in the upcoming season. Key statistical methods and algorithms, such as linear regression, K-means clustering, and decision tree regression, will be used to generate insights on player growth trajectories and value.
